# Presentation

## lil interaction language

**lil** is a domain specific language for Human Machine Interfaces specification, originally developped by Vincent Lecrubier during his Ph.D. at [ONERA](http://www.onera.fr), [ISAE](http://www.isae.fr) and [UPS Toulouse](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr) with the help of his tutors Bruno d'Ausbourg at [ONERA](http://www.onera.fr) and Yamine AÃ¯t-Ameur at [ENSEEIHT](http://www.enseeiht.fr).

**lil** aims at enabling the following :

- Specification of abstract human-machine interfaces
- Collaboration of different stakeholders on the same specification document
- Design of safety-critical human-machine interfaces
- Ensuring non ambiguous formal specification of human-machine interfaces

## lil standard framework

**lil framework** is a baseline framework designed to implement the **lil** specification canonically
It aims at enabling the following :

- Code generation for prototyping 
- Code generation of runtime backbone
- Code validation
- Model checking of interaction properties
- Model checking of performance properties
- IDE integration with syntax coloring and content assist
- Integration with [ARINC 661](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_661) via [J661](http://j661.sourceforge.net)

## Implementation

**lil** is specified in [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/). So far, due to the xtext architecture, the interaction language specification and the standard framework code are quite intricated, but here is the important:

- The syntax is defined in [Lil.xtext](com.crubier.lil/src/com/crubier/lil/Lil.xtext)
- Scoping, validation, code formatting and code generation sources are available here [here](com.crubier.lil/src/com/crubier/lil/)

# Getting started

In order to get started in developping the lil framework, you must comply with the following prerequisites :

- Have a working installation of the latest release of [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)
- Have a working installation of the latest release of [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) 

Once you are ready to install the lil framework sources into (framework_path), do the following :

1. Clone this repository

		Github >> Clone in Desktop >> to (framework_path)
		or
		Github >> Download ZIP >> Unzip in (framework_path)
		or
		Terminal >> cd (framework_path) >> git clone https://github.com/crubier/lil.git
	
	(framework_path) should now contain only one folder called lil, containing the repository files
	
2. Launch Eclipse / Xtext and switch to a fresh new workspace wherever on your machine, but NOT inside of the folder you just cloned

		In Eclipse >> File >> Switch Workspace >> Other...
		then
		Pick a new folder, typically (framework_path)/workspace
	
	(framework_path) should now contain two folders : workspace, and lil
	
3. Import the 4 Projects found in (framework_path)/lil/projects/ into your workspace

		In Eclipse >> File >> Import 
		then
		General >> Existing projects into workspace >> Next
		then
		Select root directory : (framework_path)/lil/projects/ >> Select all >> Uncheck Copy projects into workspace >> Finish
	
	Your eclipse packages explorer view should now display 4 projects in your workspace
	
4. Build the language infrastructure

		In the Eclipse package explorer view, expand the "com.crubier.lil" project
		then
		Expand the "launch" folder
		then
		Right-click "Generate lil infrastructure.launch" >> "Run as" >> "Generate lil infrastructure" 
		then 
		Wait during the language infrastructure generation
	
	Your Eclipse console view should now indicate that the MWE2 workflow succeeded without errors
	
5. Launch the lil editor runtime Eclipse

		In the Eclipse package explorer view, expand the "com.crubier.lil" project
		then
		Expand the "launch" folder
		then
		Right-click "Launch lil runtime eclipse.launch" >> "Run as" >> "Launch lil runtime eclipse" 
		then 
		Wait until the new eclipse instance is up and running
	
	You should now have two Eclipse instances running : The Xtext IDE, and the lil IDE you just launched
	
6. Import sample projects into the lil sample workspace

		In the lil IDE Eclipse >> File >> Import 
		then
		General >> Existing projects into workspace >> Next
		then
		Select root directory : (framework_path)/lil/sample projects/ >> Select all >> Uncheck Copy projects into workspace >> Finish
	
	Your lil IDE packages explorer view should now display the sample project in the lil workspace
	
7. Play with the sample projects

		In the lil IDE Eclipse >> Open any sample project
		then
		Expand the "src" folder 
		then 
		Open any "*.lil" file
	
	You are done ! You are now playing with a lil source file, enjoy
